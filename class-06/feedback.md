## Ideas and General Thoughts / Questions

- There's a TON of stuff here -- readings, challenges, labs
  - How much are we really supposed to retain after the course?
- More "workshop" style lecturing (try and buy)
- Would like some level of whiteboarding
- Super fast start ... maybe day 1 could be more of a preview
